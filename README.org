#+title:       Scripts
#+author:      Artem Smaznov
#+description: Miscalenious scripts
#+startup:     overview

These scripts are utilized in my other repositories like [[https://github.com/ArtemSmaznov/dotfiles-hyprland][dotfiles-hyprland]],
[[https://github.com/ArtemSmaznov/dotfiles-eww][dotfiles-eww]], etc.

Generally speaking, I am trying to write general scripts (not dependent on a
particular wm, compositor or framework), and to have more specific scripts in
the corresponding repo and have the general scripts call on them when
appropriate.
